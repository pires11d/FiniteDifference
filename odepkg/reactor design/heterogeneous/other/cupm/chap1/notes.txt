Here are some supplemental notes for Chapter 1.  

The Matlab routines are placed in folders named according to the
listings in Chapter 1.  Thus, for example, the routines in Listings
1.1 to 1.5 in Chapter 1 are in folder listing-1p1-1p5.  The folders
for all of the listings in Chapter 1 (Listing 1.1 to Listing 1.25) 
are: 

  listing-1p1-1p5

  listing-1p6-1p8

  listing-1p9-1p13

  listing-1p14

  listing-1p15-1p18

  listing-1p19-1p20

  listing-1p21-1p22

  listing-1p23-1p24

  listing-1p25

This set of listings was used because of the repeated use of file names.
For example, the several main programs in Chapter 1 are each named 
pde_1_main.m and the ODE routines these main programs call are named 
pde_1.m.  

The set of files in each folder should be self contained.  For example, 
the main program in folder listing-1p1-1p5 (pde_1_main.m) executes with 
the four subordinate routines in this folder, that is, pde_1.m, euler.m, 
meuler.m, rk4.m (and these five routines appear in Listing 1.1 to Listing 
1.5 in Chapter 1).

With this arrangement (the folder names linked directly to the Chapter 1
listing names) means that an extensive set of files has been placed in 
folders for the entire book.  If we have overlooked any files, which would 
become clear when the main programs are executed, please let us know and we 
will provide the missing files (routines).  We would also welcome knowing 
about your experiences in using the files.

Finally, each chapter folder generally includes a file named notes.txt 
with additional information about the files in the chapter folders.  A 
good starting point in using the files in a particular folder would be to 
first read notes.txt.  If a particular chapter folder does not have a file 
notes.txt, this means that additional information was not considered necessary, 
and the main programs (pde_1_main.m) should execute by entering pde_1_main 
(with no .m) at the Matlab prompt.  Matlab generally produces good error 
messages, including the names of any missing subordinate routines.
