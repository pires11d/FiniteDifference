             Partial Differential Equation Analysis
                    in Biomedical Engineering

              Software (Matlab routines) download

The files (Matlab routines) for the book Partial Differential Equation
Analysis in Biomedical Engineering (PDE/BME) are organized by chapter 
folders.  The chapter titles are:

  1  Introduction to Partial Differential Equation
     Integration in Space and Time

  2  Antibody Binding Kinetics

  3  Acid-mediated Tumor Growth

  4  Retinal Oxygen Transport

  5  Hemodialyzer Dynamics

  6  Epidermal Wound Healing

  7  Drug Distribution from a Polymer Matrix

Within each chapter folder, subfolders are provided according to the 
numbers of the listings of the routines in the book.  This is explained 
in file notes.txt in folder chap1.  Please read this file (notes.txt) 
first.  Since Chapter 1 has the largest number of subfolders and files, 
the use of the files in Chapters 2-7 should be straightforward. 

If you acquire the book and/or download the software, please inform us
by sending your name, affiliation (e.g., university, company, laboratory)
and e-mail address.  In this way, we can inform you of new BME applications
that we are developing.  This information will remain confidential with us.

We hope you find the book and software interesting and useful.  If you have 
any questions, please direct them to W. E. Schiesser at wes1@lehigh.edu.  In
particular, we would like to know if any files (routines) have been omitted
from this download site.

Best wishes for your PDE/BME analysis.
